## [v0.3.0] - 2019-11-25

> NOTICE: When migrating from a 0.2.x chart to a 0.3 chart, please take the following into account:

- if you use the `env` key in your values, you should rewrite them from a
   plain dict into a list of [EnvVar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.16/#envvar-v1-core)

### Added

* Add ability to [annotate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) pods in the StatefulSet
* Add ability to run any script as callback, if exposed as a ConfigMap

### Changed
 * Reduce loglevel of Patroni from INFO to WARNING
 * The values.yaml env key should be expressed as a list of [EnvVar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.16/#envvar-v1-core)s
 * Refer to the latest minor versions for PostgreSQL & TimescaleDB

### Fixed
 * Set `unix_socket_permissions` using PostgreSQL parameters instead

## [v0.2.5] - 2019-11-06

### Added
 * Add [readiness probe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-readiness-probes) for PostgreSQL
 * Allow a (debug) command to run at container startup
 * Add a [Headless Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#headless-services) (by default),
   with the option to convert it into a Load Balancer
### Changed
 * Rename backup.enable to backup.enabled for consistency, the old naming does still work.
 * Rename postgresExporter to prometheus

## [v0.2.4] - 2019-11-05

### Changed
 * Use 2.0.0-beta3 Docker Image for multinode
 * Allow [postgres-exporter](https://github.com/wrouesnel/postgres_exporter) to run as a sidecar

## [v0.2.3] - 2019-11-01

### Added
 * Allow annotations to be specified for the Load Balancer in the values.yaml file

## [v0.2.2] - 2019-10-31

### Changed
 * Use TimescaleDB 1.5 Docker image by default

## [v0.2.1] - 2019-10-22

### Changed
 * Point to the -latest Docker image tag for multinode by default
### Fixed
 * Always explicitly set wal directory
 * (multinode) Drop the TimescaleDB extension from the Data Nodes to allow a clean bootstrap to be done

## [v0.2.0] - 2019-10-16
### Added
 * A preliminary multinode Helm chart
 * Architecture diagrams
 * Allow multiple volumes for the data directory and the WAL directory
 * Documentation pgBackRest restore outside of Kubernetes environment

### Changed
 * The defined Patroni configuration is passed on (using a ConfigMap) to Patroni
 * Secrets required by Patroni are injected using environment variables
 * The defined pgBackRest configuration is passed on to pgBackRest (using a Secret as it holds credentials)
 * The entrypoint no longer points to scripts in the Docker image, this pretty much allows any Docker image
     to be used, as long as it contains PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, and pgBackRest
 * Best practice PostgreSQL parameters, e.g. enable logging of connections by default
 * Open Sourced this repository as Apache License 2.0

## [v0.1.0] - 2019-09-04
